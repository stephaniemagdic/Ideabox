## Week 4 (Mod1) at Turing School of Software and Design
### [Project Spec](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-1/ideabox-group.html)

Every developer has more ideas than time. As David Allen likes to say “the human brain is for creating ideas, not remembering them.”
IdeaBox is the creative space that allows you to store those genius shower thoughts and daydreams in one spot.  That way you can get them 
out of your head and concentrate on your day to day tasks.  Come back to IdeaBox when you have more free time so you can really bring
your ideas to life!

## Instructions for running and viewing

You can start creating your own idea cards here [Ideabox](https://stephaniemagdic.github.io/Ideabox/) 

* **Making a New Card:**  Enter a title in the `Title` field.  Enter your idea in the `Body` field.  When you are ready to create your idea card, click the `Save` button.  Your new card will appear in the empty space below.


* **Removing a Card:**  To remove one of your cards simply press the `X` button on the top right of the card you wish to delete.


* **Marking a Card as Favorite:**  To mark an idea card as a favorite, click the `white star` button on the top left of the card.  The star will turn red to indicate that card as a favorite.  To remove as a favorite card click the star button again and it will return to normal.


* **Show Only Favorite Ideas:**  If you only want to see your favorite cards (cards with the red star), click the `Show Starred Ideas` button on the top left of the page.  To see all cards again, click the same button that will now say `Show All Ideas`.


* **Search Idea Cards:**  To search the idea cards for a specific card, enter the title or other text that is on the card in the `Search` field.  The cards will filter as you type and only the cards that match will appear on the page.
